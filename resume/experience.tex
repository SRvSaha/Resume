        \item\textbf {Phrase Extraction from English Sentences for Clausal Identification} 
        \item{\textbf{Field} : Information Extraction, Data Mining, Data Structures, Algorithms}
        \item{The system built on the top of Stanford Parser and NLTK can detect various type of Phrases and
 can separate them automatically which can be used to extract Clauses from texts.}
        \item{Developed a recursive algorithm
 based on stack data structure which keep track of the start and end of phrases within Phrases. The task
 is recursively solved to extract the phrases along with their type.}

        \item{\textbf{Field} : Information Extraction, Information Retrieval, Text Mining}
        \item{Since searching within the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page of a web site is a critical task: customers might feel overloaded by many irrelevant questions and become frustrated due to the difficulty in finding the FAQ suitable for their problems. Perhaps they are right there, but just worded in a different way than they know.}
        \item{Developed a search-engine which can effectively retrieve a list of most relevant FAQs and corresponding answers related to the query issued by the user. Used Combinatorics approach for query and by rating each result fetched on a scale like 3,2,1, the most relevant one is shown.}
        \item{Our system can effectively give \textbf{~97\%} relevant search results based on the queries of the user which is much better than any prevalent IR methodologies.}

      \begin{cvitems}
      \item{\textbf{Field} : Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Textual Semantic Similarity}
        \item {Our system  NLP-NITMZ is based on three features: Unigram Matching Ratio, Levenshtein Ratio and Cosine Similarity using Vector Space Model.}
        \item {Built two classifiers which can tag paraphrases, non-paraphrases and semi-phrases in Indian Languages,
namely Hindi, Malayalam, Punjabi and Tamil. Our classifiers are built on the top of Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine,
Random Forest, Decision Tree, J48 Machine learning algorithms and gives \textbf{~95\%+} accuracy in the Train Set. In Test Set, we got \textbf{91.55\%} in Hindi, \textbf{83.44\%} in Malayalam, \textbf{94.20\%} in Punjabi and \textbf{83.44\%} accuracy in Tamil.}
    \item{For Machine Learning portion we have used \textbf{Probabilistic neural network(PNN)} to predict the class.}

    {
      \begin{cvitems}
        \item{\textbf{Field} : Social Media Code Mixing, Information Extraction, Information Retrieval}
        \item{Built a system that can deal with the noisy nature of microblogs(\textbf{TWITTER}) which are very small (at most 140 characters) and often written informally, using abbreviations, colloquial terms, etc, and 
effective developed IR methodologies for extracting important information from microblogs posted during disasters.}
        \item{Our system can effective show the most relevant results related to each topic(Tweets) with high precision Twitter data.}
